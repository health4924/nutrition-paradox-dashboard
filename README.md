# nutrition-paradox-dashboard
An interactive Streamlit dashboard that analyzes global obesity and malnutrition trends using WHO data, offering region-wise, gender-wise, and age-wise insights through predefined SQL queries.

**A Global View on Obesity and Malnutrition**

---

## Project Overview

This project is an interactive dashboard that explores global data on obesity and malnutrition using publicly available datasets from the World Health Organization (WHO). It provides insights into global health and nutrition trends by analyzing obesity and malnutrition levels across different countries, regions, genders, and age groups.

The dashboard is built using **Streamlit** and connects to a **MySQL** database backend to run complex SQL queries that power the visualizations and data tables. This tool helps researchers, students, and health professionals understand the "Nutrition Paradox" â€” how obesity and malnutrition coexist globally.

## Features

- Explore obesity and malnutrition data by region, country, year, gender, and age.
- Run predefined queries to analyze trends and comparisons.
- Visualize results in an easy-to-understand table format.
- Compare obesity and malnutrition side-by-side for comprehensive insights.
- Filter data dynamically based on user input.
